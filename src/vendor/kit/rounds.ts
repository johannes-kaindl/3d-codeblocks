// vendored from code-kit@0.15.4, src/ts/pure/rounds.ts — do not hand-edit; re-vendor via tools/sync-kit.sh
/** History of several LLM rounds with step-back. Each round is whatever the caller stores
 *  (input, output, model, ...); this module only knows the list and which round is active.
 *
 *  Three independent instances existed before this one (obsidian-plugins/, 2026-07..2026-09):
 *  `lingotuner/src/core/session.ts` (`Session{rounds, active}`, `addRound`, `selectRound`,
 *  `basedOn`), `obsidian-transmute/src/core/session.ts` (phase `preview{versions, active}`,
 *  `selectVersion`, "refine builds on the active version") and
 *  `image-to-markdown/src/img_to_md_state.ts` (`RefineRound[]` per card, `selectRefineVersion`).
 *  All three share the same rule: **the selection belongs to the state** — refining after a
 *  step back appends after the last round and builds on the *active* one, nothing is cut off.
 *
 *  ── What stayed with the callers, and why ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  The round content (`T`) — dials, instruction, hits, source name — is domain data and stays a
 *  type parameter. The strip that shows the rounds is UI with its own grammar per plugin (see
 *  `obsidian-kit/obsidian/version-list`). Streaming, abort and transport are not here either.
 *  image-to-markdown keeps index 0 for the original text (`base`) and counts rounds from 1;
 *  that is a display convention of its card, not a property of the history, so `active` here is
 *  always an index into `rounds` (-1 without a round) and the caller adds the offset.
 *
 *  All functions are pure: they return a new model or, where nothing changes, the same object.
